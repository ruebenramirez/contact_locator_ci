contact_locator_ci
==================

Conversion of the nasty PHP I wrote once upon a time (https://github.com/ruebenramirez/Contact-Locator) ...over to CodeIgniter.

Project goals:
* API for adding/removing contacts
* full admin portal backend to provide a UI for administrative functions (i.e. CRUD on contacts and their various details)
* A pleasant jQuery meets KendoUI AJAX enabled front-end consuming the API for display and interaction with the available contacts in various forms (Google Maps, list form, grid, etc.)
